# LLM: Legal Layman's Mansplaininator

It is a well known fact and issue that laws and regulations are always playing catch up with emerging technologies. This makes it extremely challenging for lawyers to understand how electronic evidence should be handled when technology is always advancing and how to infer admissibility upon forensic expert testimony on such technology. This testimony
often leads to dealing with extremely technical details. For lawyers, the technical jargon, as well as the constant evolution of new technology, is incredibly hard to keep up with. Similarly, for Forensic Examiners, finding ways to explain highly complex technical evidence to juries, lawyers, and judges is increasingly a challenging aspect as
technology gets more interconnected.

## Objectives of the Project

1. Create a RAG model and pair it with an LLM to be able to highlight potentially non-compliant portions of a technical witness testimony.
2. Create prompts for an LLM to generate translations from technical Jargon to easy-to-understand summaries with analogies of technical details.
3. Create a visual interface for a user to easily paste written witness testimony for analysis and feedback.
